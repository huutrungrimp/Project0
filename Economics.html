        <h1>Resources and Livelihoods</h1>
        <p>
          The community lives on agriculture, aquaculture, forestry and exploitation of natural resources. Agriculture is the key sector because it not only engages but also provides almost all the community a major source of foods and household income. Agriculture involves diverse activities, but most households live on subsidiary and rice cultivation as well as livestock and poultry production. In addition to the agriculture sector, the residents also have some alternative livelihoods that provide them with an additional source of foods and income, for example exploitation of river clams and wild shrimp. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The community has a diverse suite of resources, which have been used to support the human security and livelihoods of the villagers. These resources are classified into five groups including financial, physical, natural, human and social capitals although they play different roles in the community. These resources are unevenly distributed across the community. For instance, wild fish and clams are concentrated in Lang, while others such as Melaleuca forests and CTT are mainly distributed in Dong. However, many resources in Tuong Van, for instance the land for rice and shrimp production and flood dikes are concentrated in Lang.        
        </p>
        <p>
          Tuong Van has various livelihoods. The main agricultural activities are paddy rice, subsidiary crops and vegetables, as well as livestock and poultry. Rice production is traditional livelihood and involves about 50% of the households. Rice is the food supply throughout the year, but subsidiary crops and animal production provide daily food and additional income for households. Apart from agriculture, about 50% of households involved in aquaculture including shrimp and freshwater fish. Shrimp culture is a commercial activity for both Lang and Dong residents, but freshwater fish is only stocked in Dong as a main source of food and additional income. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Tuong Van also involves in exploitation of natural resources including clams, wild vegetables, and medical herbs, but residents in Lang and Dong use the resources differently. River clams, wild fish and vegetables on flooding abandoned rice fields, and nuts are collected commonly by Lang residents, while Dong mainly exploit medical herb rather than involving in Lang’s livelihood activities.
