          The commune is threatened by rapid onset hazards including storms and floods in the rainy seasons due to its direct exposure to the Thach Han River and the South China Sea. Over the last three decades, the commune has been threatened by six storms and floods. Most floods and storms occurred during October and November. The flood in 1983 was the most disastrous, not only killed 148 people but also damaged over 4,500 houses. Some floods occurred with storms. For instance, the storms in 1999 and 2005 not only damaged houses, but also induced subsequent floods, which swept away many houses. In addition, the commune has also been affected by gradual and prolonged stressors such as droughts and salinization during summers.
