          <h1>About Trieu Phong district and Quang Tri province</h1>
          <p>
            Trieu Phong is a district of the Quang Tri province, which is located in the North Central Coast of Vietnam and covers a total area of 4,700 square kilometres. Mountains and hills are concentrated to the west and they occupy 80% of the provincial territory. The remaining quarter of the province accounts for plains and sandy areas along the coast, where agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries are concentrated. The province has nearly 600,000 inhabitants living in 10 districts, four of which are bordered by the South China Sea.   
          </p>

            The annual average GDP of the province grew by 10.7% for the period from 2006 to 2011, but its average income per capita remained low at US$ 1,000. Between 25% and 45% of the population was classified as poor for the period of 2004 to 2010 and Quang Tri is one of the four poorest provinces in the central coast. There was a shift in the economic structure of the province over the last two decades. The economy of the province was characterized by the extensive development of agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries during the 1990s, but then it has gradually been supplanted by the construction and manufacturing sectors. In 2014, the agriculture, aquaculture and fishery sectors contributed a smaller portion, approximately 25%, to the provincial GDP, but they provided employment to 66% of the provincial population.

            Quang Tri has a tropical monsoon climate, with the daily maximum temperature varying between 7.7 and 42.1⁰C. The rainy season usually lasts from September to December and it is characterized by heavy rains, storms and floods. The dry season typically starts from March and ends in late August and it is characterized by hot and dry southwest monsoons and droughts. The province has been impacted by a wide range of climate hazards, of which floods and storms are considered as the key threats. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Fifty-six major climate events, especially storms and floods, leading to human and economic losses have happened over the last two decades. The most disastrous flood (1999) killed 58 people and damaged 3,000 houses across the province, while the most devastating storm (Ketsana in 2009) damaged 42,000 houses, with 12 human deaths and 33 injuries. Overall, the number of human deaths during 2010s was reduced by 50% in comparison to the period of 1990s, but the number of damaged houses and human injuries increased considerably over the same period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trieu Phong and Hai Lang districts are the most vulnerable to climate hazards because they are directly exposed to large rivers and the South China Sea. Trieu Phong has been more susceptible to storms and floods in terms of economic loss and human injuries, thus it was selected for this research. Besides storms and floods, this district has also been affected by gradual and prolonged stressors such as droughts, sea level rise, and salinization of ground water and soil. These stressors have not caused loss of human life, but recent reports reveal significant impacts on human health and the livelihood of local communities across the province.
