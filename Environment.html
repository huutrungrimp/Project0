      <h1>Biophysical conditions in Tuong Van</h1>
      <p>
        Tuong Van is exposed directly to the Thach Han River, which is approximately 800 meters wide and annually brings floods to the community. The village is about 1.5 km away from the mouth of the river opening to the Cua Viet Sea, which commonly receives strong winds and storm surges. Moreover, the community is frequently flooded by high tides because most of its land is no more than 4 meters above sea level.

        The villagers, their livelihoods and resources are highly vulnerable to climate hazards as they are exposed to hazardous zone. Despite being in the same community, Lang and Dong have different levels of vulnerability as they have geographically and climatically different conditions. Lang has been more exposed to floods, storm surges, tidal flooding and salinization as it is located closer to the Thach Han River and the Cua Viet Sea. Dong is less vulnerable to these hazards since it is shielded by An Loi and Lang, but they have been at higher risks to rain flooding in rainy seasons as its residents live in the valleys beneath sandy hills, which is annually flooded by heavy rains. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At least nine climate-related hazards have threatened the community over the last three decades. Beside rapid-onset hazards including storms and floods, the community has also been impacted by seven gradual and prolonged stressors such as droughts and salinization. Some hazards such as floods and droughts are routine, while others are relatively new to the community, for instance sea level rise and the resulting salinization. Among the nine hazards, floods and droughts as the most important. It is critical to note that, from community perspectives, storms were evaluated less important than flooding induced by heavy rains and high tides although they are considered one of the top two hazards across Vietnam.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impacts of changing climate on the community vary over time. Climate hazards threaten the community throughout the year, but the most disastrous in rainy and dry seasons. In the rainy seasons, the community suffers most from storms, floods and flooding, while during dry seasons it is threatened by droughts and salinization. The community has been increasingly at climate risks as it is not only exposed to recurrent threats, but it also confronts with emerging impacts of climate change such as rising sea level and increasing salinization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changing climate has impacted the community in different ways. Some climate events such as southwest and northeast monsoons have become less adverse, while sea level rise and the resulting salinization have increasingly threatened the community. Climate impacts also vary across the community. Lang have been threatened more heavily by floods, droughts, tidal flooding and salinization, while Dong has suffered more from flooding induced by heavy rains. Climate hazards do not threaten resources of the community in the same way. For instance, freshwater is highly impacted by salinization and droughts, while the dike and transport systems are severely eroded by floods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The adverse impacts of changing climate on Tuong Van community are a result of complex interactions among climate hazards and geographical conditions. Climate hazards do not occur independently but rather they interact one with others. For instance, salinization is resulted from tidal flooding, while storms commonly cause floods. Each hazard has its own impacts, but it could become more disastrous if it occurs with others. For instance, salinization in Tuong Van was resulted from tidal flooding during rainy seasons and its impacts were magnified by droughts during dry seasons. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it is important to note that climate events have also provided the community with some benefits or opportunities although they have caused losses of life and properties. For example, a flood might erode dike system, but it could provide the residents with wide fish and shrimps as a source of foods and additional income. In addition, a hazard could magnify, but it might also reduce the impacts of other hazards. As an example, tidal flooding and droughts could magnify limiting impacts of salinization on crops, but such effects might be reduced by heavy rains and floods following the tidal flooding.
