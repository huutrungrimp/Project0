# Project0
The website illustrates part of a research project, which focused on climatic changes and community resilience and was conducted by Trung Nguyen in the Tuong Van Community (village). At this initial stage of the website development, a short socio-economic and environmental description of the community was presented. The discription will be rewriten and a few more sections such as the vulnerabity of the community and its climate change adaptation actions will be added. The community has extensive experiences on climate change adaptation, but they also need help from global communities. The website serve a platform, where the Tuong Van community, scholars and donors could meet their common interests.
